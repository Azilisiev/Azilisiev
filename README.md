## I'am an e-drawer too

I do e-drawings too. I'm not a professional but I can do some stuff. I can modify any image with enough time and motivation, and i'm getting better at making my own characters. I sometimes spend hours on reverse searching images to find a better quality or original artist of a drawing.
